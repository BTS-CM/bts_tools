.. BTS Tools documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Wed Jan 21 12:02:39 2015.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the BTS Tools documentation!
=======================================

There are 2 tools currently provided:

- command line util allowing to quickly build and run the BitShares client
- web app allowing to monitor a running instance of the client and send
  an email or push notification on failure

If you like these tools, please vote for `my delegate`_
(web page: `http://digitalgaia.io/btstools.html <http://digitalgaia.io/btstools.html>`_)
to support further development, and feel free to visit my page for other
delegate proposals at `digitalgaia.io <http://digitalgaia.io>`_. Thanks!

To get started, just type the following in a shell::

    $ pip install bts_tools

and follow through the documentation. If you want a hands-on approach to
setting up a delegate from scratch, please head to the following section: :doc:`howto`
